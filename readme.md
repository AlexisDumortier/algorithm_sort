# Algorithm Sort

This is a small sorting program made in Ruby to help practice algorithmic thinking. The Ruby method .sort will sort data automatically, but the value and practice of developing a sort is beneficial for advanced programming.

### Project Status

* This project was started before my acceptance to Turing School of Software and Design, and its in need of refactoring
* The algorithm_sort.rb file is heavily commented to help explain the program to new contributors
* The project contains a .gitignore file for .DS_Store files

### Things to do

* **Practice Git and GitHub workflows**
  * Fork & Clone the project
  * Create a new branch to contribute your work
  * When changes are ready create a pull request
  * I will practice code reviews and merges to the master for your branch


* **Add features**
  * ~~User input. Allow the user to add as many words to the sort as they would like~~
  * New types of sorting. Create Classes that will sort different data in unique ways
  * ~~Update the output display. A better design for readability~~
  * Sort SQL data from PostgreSQL
  * Create a Rails application that uses the Algorithm Sort logic

### Communication

* I will be active responding to questions, comments, and suggestions
* Please let me know if you have feature suggestions for the readme.md
* I am very rusty (see: mostly new) at managing a public repo with multiple contributors; please understand there will be learning mistakes
