# Algorithm Sort

This is a small sorting program made in Ruby to help practice algorithmic thinking. The Ruby method .sort will sort data automatically, but the value and practice of developing a sort is beneficial for advanced programming.

### Project Status

* This project was started before my acceptance to Turing School of Software and Design, and its in need of refactoring
* The algorithm_sort.rb file is heavily commented to help explain the program to new contributors
* The project contains a .gitignore file for .DS_Store files
* I will be adding Continuous Integration sometime soon, probably with TravisCI
* I am debating adding Hound for automated code checks

### Things to do:

**Practice Git and GitHub workflows**
  * Fork & Clone the project
  * Switch to the `dev` branch
    * Using a development branch is common practice at many companies, and I would like to practice that process with you
  * Create a new branch, `git checkout -b <branchname>` to develop and contribute your work
  * When changes are ready create a pull request to merge your feature branch into the `dev` branch
  * I will practice code review, discussion, and testing with your pull request
    * This is intentionally low stakes for us (contributors + me) to practice the process, and is based on positive reinforcement, empathy, and learning. Your contribution is **welcome** and **encouraged!**
    * Merge conflicts are our (contributors + me) primary focus


**Add features**
  * ~~User input. Allow the user to add as many words to the sort as they would like~~
  * New types of sorting
  * Create Classes that sort different data in unique ways
  * ~~Update the output display. A better design for readability~~
  * Sort SQL data from PostgreSQL
  * Create a Rails application that uses the Algorithm Sort logic

### Communication

* I will be active responding to questions, comments, and suggestions
* Please let me know if you have feature suggestions for the readme.md
* I am very rusty (see: mostly new) at managing a public repo with multiple contributors; please understand there will be learning mistakes
